## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Forms per ACTION (transition), not per task — different actions need different fields
- Symfony ExpressionLanguage for gateway conditions — full EL power
- Variable namespacing by node ID — prevents key collisions across stages
- Pool tasks with pessimistic lock claim — prevents double-assignment race condition
- Form schema snapshot at task creation — prevents schema drift from definition updates

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Expression publish-time validation scope needs design during Phase 1 (which nodes produce which variables)
- OrganizationQueryPort must include orgId scoping on all methods — verify before Phase 2
- Zod 4.3.6 import compatibility with existing codebase — verify before Phase 4
